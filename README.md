# Context
Deploying a Microservices architecture in conjunction with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for our application CommUNIcate represents a strategic choice designed to attain scalability, flexibility, testability, fault isolation, modularity, maintainability, and enhanced user engagement. This approach best contributes and is aligned with our overarching business objectives.

## Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern:
The MVC pattern separates the application into three interconnected components: the Model (data and business logic), the View (user interface), and the Controller (handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly). This separation of concerns enhances flexibility, scalability, testability, maintainability and team development.

## Microservices Architecture:
The Microservices architecture involves breaking down a complex application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. This architecture boosts modularity, scalability, testability, fault isolation and facilitates team collaboration and development.

## Alignment with Business Goals:
- **Scalability:** With this hybrid design, each component can be scaled independently based on demand. This enables CommUNIcate to handle varying levels of traffic, requests and management effectively, ensuring optimal performance during usage lifecycles. Furthermore, we can easily scale to accommodate a growing user base without sacrificing performance or reliability. This scalability is crucial for supporting the platform's growth and ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Flexibility:** Our proposed design promotes flexibility by allowing teams to choose the most suitable technology stack for each service. This enables rapid innovation and the adoption of new technologies without affecting the entire system. By adopting this architecture, we can optimize resource allocation and infrastructure usage. We can dynamically adjust the scale of individual services according to demand, offering flexibility in resource allocation and enabling cost-effective operations while maximizing efficiency.
- **Testability / Fault Isolation:** Since each microservice operates independently, faults or failures in one service do not necessarily impact the entire system. This enhances the overall resilience and reliability of the application. Furthermore, the design provides greater testability as each component and service can be tested independently, making it easier to identify and address performance-related issues in a fine-grained manner.
- **Modularity and Maintainability:** Breaking the application into smaller, loosely-coupled services and components promotes modularity and ease of maintenance. We can focus on individual services without being concerned about the entire application architecture. Furthermore, this fosters improved team collaboration and coordination, enabling the division of tasks and concurrent development of individual services.

## Prior Related Work:
Prior experience with similar projects or technologies may have influenced the decision to use a microservices architecture and MVC pattern for CommUNIcate. Lessons learned from past projects, industry practices, and research papers influenced the architectural design choices to ensure the success of the platform.

In summary, adopting a microservices architecture alongside the MVC pattern for CommUNIcate aligns with broader business goals of scalability, flexibility, testability/fault isolation, modularity, maintainability and user engagement. This design approach leverages industry best practices and prior experience and knowledge to create an efficient and adaptable platform that meets the evolving needs of the university community.


# Detailed Design
## Overall system architecture:
The overall system architecture will include a combination of MVC and microservices. The high-level organization of the code will be divided into three components. Firstly, the Model will include a multitude of microservices, each performing a specific task. Each of these microservices may communicate with their own decentralized database, separating potentially sensitive data. The View component will contain all logic related to the user interface. This includes a view microservice which will be implemented to communicate with the other services via an API gateway. Finally, the Controller will be used to facilitate communication between the two other components. This is done through an API gateway which will be implemented in the controller layer. The API gateway acts as a reverse proxy which accepts client API calls and forwards them to the appropriate microservice. Microservices further enhance our applications' scalability, maintainability, and team development, as microservices allow for the application to be broken down into smaller independent segments. These independent services can be targeted for specific development and testing, which streamlines the development process. The combination of these major architecture patterns allow for a highly flexible and efficient system that can easily adapt to evolving business requirements.
## How users Interact with the system:
Initially, users will be prompted to enter their personal and university specific information. This will include their year and program of study, and any additional details, including interests, clubs, and specific classes they are currently enrolled in. Once the profile is created, it can be updated at any time. Certain fields will automatically update, including incrementing the userâ€™s current year of study and removing completed courses at the end of each semester. Every user has the option to add as many friends from the University as they would like. Friend recommendations will be displayed based on similar class schedules. A search option allows the user to find other individuals in the same university. Once a friend has accepted the request, users can message them directly through the application. Additionally, a user can click on a specific class they are enrolled in and see others in the same class and chat with a direct class message board. In relation to the system architecture, the user will directly interact with the View component of our appreciation. This part of the application contains the user interface (UI), and contacts the Controller and Model components to gather and build the necessary data for the UI based on the user's request. This is shown below in Figure 1. 
## How software components interact:
The interaction between software components within our system follows a clear and structured flow. The Controller component acts as the intermediary between the View and Model components, facilitating the exchange of data and instructions. When a user interacts with the UI, such as making a request to view their class schedule or send a message to a friend, the View component triggers corresponding actions within the Controller. The Controller then processes these actions, retrieving or updating data from the Model component as necessary. For example, when a user requests to view their class schedule, the Controller queries the Model to fetch the relevant data from the database and passes it back to the View for display. Similarly, when a user sends a message to a friend, the Controller updates the appropriate records in the database through the Model component before confirming the action to the user via the View. On a lower level, microservices within each MVC component interact through an API gateway, which acts as a single entry point into the system. The API gateway controls the flow of requests within the system, sending requests and responses to and from the appropriate microservice. This can be seen in Figure 1 below.
## How data flows through the system:
The flow of data through our system is designed to ensure efficient processing and seamless user experiences. Upon receiving input from the user through the View component (such as submitting a profile update or initiating a friend request), the data is transmitted to the Controller for processing. Within the controller, the API gateway forwards the client API call to the appropriate receiving microservice. This forwarded request is then processed within the receiving microservice, and the result is then sent back to the calling service. Through this processing of the requests, if information must be persistently stored or retrieved, the microservice will contact its database and perform the required operations. As such, the API gateway (within the Controller component) will be central in coordinating the flow of data and requests within the system. This systematic
